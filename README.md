## 🛠️ How to Get It Up and Running

Easy peasy, just follow the vibes:

1. **Turn off antivirus & firewall.** This is key – mod menus trip up defenses.
2. **Unpack the archive** you got (probably zipped up).
3. **Run the loader as admin.** Always go full boss mode.
4. **Launch Lost Ark**, then use your custom keybind to bring up the menu (usually `Insert` or `F4`).
5. **Pick your cheats** and get wild. 😈

💡 *Pro tip: Use an alt account first if you’re feeling cautious. No one wants their main yeeted.*
